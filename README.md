Environment Setup:

It uses the dotenv library to load environment variables from a .env file.
Imports necessary libraries like streamlit, os, pathlib, PIL (for image processing), and google.generativeai to interact with Google's Generative AI API.
Google Generative AI Configuration:

Retrieves the Google API key from the environment variables and configures the Generative AI service using this key.
Function Definitions:

get_gemini_response: Takes input text, an image, and a prompt, and uses the Generative AI model ('gemini-pro-vision') to generate a response based on this input.
input_image_setup: Prepares the uploaded image for processing in a format suitable for the Generative AI service.
Streamlit App Setup:

Initializes a Streamlit application.
Displays a header for the Gemini Application.
Provides text input for the user's prompt and a file uploader for the image.
When the "Answer my query" button is clicked, it reads the user's input and uploaded image, prepares the image data, generates a response using the Generative AI model, and displays the response on the Streamlit interface.
The application seems to facilitate interaction with the Gemini API by providing an input prompt and an image to generate AI-driven responses.
